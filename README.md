## :star2: About the Project

The presented application is designed for tracking data related to the condition of owned bicycles, as well as the dates and details of their maintenance. It operates based on data retrieved from the Strava API. The idea for this application was born out of a simple request from a friend who said, "Write something that keeps track of the kilometers since the last marked date." Since then, it has become clear that he owns more than one bicycle, and each bicycle has more than one chain. It is necessary to associate each "ride" from Strava with a specific chain and bicycle based on the last change date of the chain. Additionally, the application allows users to add notes about other maintenance work along with relevant dates.

### :tada: Inspiration
The inspiration for this application came from a friend's need to keep track of the kilometers ridden since the last mainstence. What initially seemed like a straightforward request quickly evolved as it became evident that he has much more ideas. This complexity led to the development of a comprehensive solution for tracking and managing bicycle data effectively.
